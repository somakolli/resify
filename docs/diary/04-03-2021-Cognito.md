## Finished
### Cognito Integration
Implemented basic authentication with cognito for admin-ui and the api-service.

###### Frontend
the frontend integration was not very convenient (firebase is easier for fronted).
i installed amplify. with it i could configure the user pool in aws with the console and the it added all the configuration to the app.
the it was just a matter of calling sign in and out through the auth api.
it need to figure out a way how to set this up programaticly for deployment and testing.

###### Backend
Backend integration was very easy.
Just add the jwt token issuer to the applocation properties and spring  oauth 2 resource server handles the rest.
For testing I might use an oauth moking server like this: https://github.com/navikt/mock-oauth2-server.
I wrote the basic test and the API works, but i have to secure every Endpoint: check if the user creating and getting data is authorized to do so.

## To Do for tomorrow

- check out swr
- integrate frontend with backend
- secure all endpoints
