## Share scripts between Projects
I just copied the scripts over to the customer ui.

## Customer UI routing
I implemented the routing for the cusomer ui.
```/company/calendar``` is its own route. From then on I will just switch up components for the reservation process.
Today I implemented the ui up until and including the service selection.

## TODO Tomorrow
- finish up the customer ui
