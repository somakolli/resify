## Authentication absctraction in ui
To easily switch between authentication providers in the frontend I'm going to implement an authentication interface.
Then for each auth provider an implementation of the interface has to be written.

I'm doing this to specificaly be able to switch between authentication providers in development and production.
For development I'm usign an oauth2-mock-server, which just returns a token without any credentials.
In production I'm using cognito.

Switching Auth providers in the backend is very easy as long as they implement the open id connect spec: https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#rnc.
Maybe I should use oidc to facilitate login with other providers and not use amazons built in solution.

I completed the auth provider interface. Took longer than expected, but now I at least have a good understanding of how async await work in typescript.
They are basically promises but instead of using .then().catch() you use try catch and await which is a bit tidier if you have nested async functions.
Interesting to note is that Promise error can't be asigned to a type in typescript.

## Todo tomorrow
- either break day or finally finish backend integration
