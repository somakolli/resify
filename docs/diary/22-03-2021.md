## Company
Calendars are no longer associated to users but to companies.
Every user belongs to one company.
If no company is found for a user they are requested to create one.
For personal accounts the company name is just a user name.
I'm thinking about locking multi user support behind a pay wall.

## Customer UI
I ran into a problem with the watch effect implementation in nuxt.
It isn't the same as in vue 3.
It ran into an endles loop for some reason.
So I had to implement the functionality without watch effect.

## TODO for tomorrow
- Add companies to postman.
- Add company creation to Admin ui
