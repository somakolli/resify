## i3 and vim
Moved to i3 and vim to cut my dependency on jetbrains and I'm making my goal to only use open source software for development.
It cost me like 2 days but I think It will be worth it in the long run.

## sharing ts modules
I want to share modules between my admin-ui and customer-ui.
It was a good Idea to use a monorepo for all of my projects, but I could not just reference a ts file and include it.
You can define an external path in the typescript config and reference that path with @ like this:

```json
"paths": {    
   "@/*": ["src/*"],
   "@share/*": ["../share/javascript/*"]
}
```
The problem is that babel needs to compile those typescript files and it looks for the closest eslint config file and the typescript module.
So you need to make the library an npm/yarn project and add typescript and eslint config:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  env: {
    browser: true,
  },
  root: true,
  parser: "@typescript-eslint/parser",
  plugins: ["@typescript-eslint"],
  extends: ["eslint:recommended", "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended"],
};
```
Now I need to figure out a way to share components.
