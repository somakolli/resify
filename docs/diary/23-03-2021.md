## Permission controls
I decides to create a Permission entity which contains an id to which the Permission is granted, a permission scope and a permission type(read, write, ...).
In the scope you can either declare that all fields are contained in the permission or specify specific fields like reservations or workslots (needs to be properly implemented).

## TODO for tomorrow
- Add company creation to Admin ui
