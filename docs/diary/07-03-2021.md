## Api Service functions

Wrote crud functions for calendars, reservations and services.
I still need to write them for users and workslots.
For the workslost I need to write a workslot configuration, so the user can configure the workslots for each day of the week.
After that is done I need to create the actual workslots for every day of the week in a scheduled task that runs every day.


### Problem with JS classes type caseing.

Had a problem with fetch commonJS class casting.
Vue didn't recognise the returned objects as CalendarModels.
Might have to rewrite service functions to acommodate this and specificaly cast every object that is returned or just ignore it as this is a slight performance loss.


## TODO for tomorrow
- create workslot configuration
- write tests for services in the ui
