## Sharing vue components
I tried building a seperate library but it didn't work and I thought that so much boilerplate to just share some files is too much.
I also tried bit. That worked but I think adding a dependecy on some other service just to share files which are like two folders away is also to much.
I eventually settled with just using hard links and added a command to build and serve to always relink the files.
It actually works quite good.
