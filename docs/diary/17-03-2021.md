## Sharing vue components
I tried building a seperate library but it didn't work and I thought that so much boilerplate to just share some files is too much.
I also tried bit. That worked but I think adding a dependecy on some other service just to share files which are like two folders away is also to much.
I eventually settled with just using hard links and added a command to build and serve to always relink the files.
It actually works quite good.

...

Or Not! Nuxt and vue need different imports for the composition api. 
Nuxt needs ```@nuxt/composition-api``` while vue needs just ```vue```.
So I decided to just set a placeholder for the composition api and copy the files into the right folders and replace it with the correct composition api import.
For that I wrote a specific generateComponents shell script for each one of the projects.
